2Real-Time Chat Application using WebSocket
Welcome to the Real-Time Chat Application using WebSocket project! This project leverages WebSocket technology to create a fast and efficient chat system that enables real-time communication between users. Whether you're building a team collaboration tool, a customer support platform, or a social networking application, this project provides a solid foundation for implementing real-time chat functionality.

The Real-Time Chat Application offers a seamless user experience with instant message delivery, presence indicators, and support for multiple users in the same chat room. It is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing you to customize the user interface and integrate additional features as needed.

To get started, ensure you have a basic understanding of WebSocket technology and web development fundamentals. Clone the repository, and you'll find everything you need to set up the chat application. The project includes server-side code written in Python using frameworks like Flask or Django, as well as client-side code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Configure the system by updating the necessary settings such as server address and port in the configuration files. Once configured, you can run the server application and open the client application in your web browser to start chatting in real-time.

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving the user interface, adding new features, or optimizing the code for performance, we encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
